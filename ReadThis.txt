Ok, looks like you have installed ConstantVigil Games. Nice! From here, you'll want to go into the folder "Vigilant", and open 
"HomePage.html". After that, you'll want to install our release "AddGames". Then, you should have all of your games on a portal
in "HomePage.html". Happy Gaming!


























(We Do NOT own these games, we are simply compiling them for ease of access.)
